# Millimetre

Millimetre is a serie of fonts constructed on a grid based on the metric system. Each em is devided in 10 units vertically and horizontally. Printed at a 1 cm size, the strokes of the regular will be 1 mm thick. Both white spaces and black stems fit on this grid. Half of the lines and columns of this 10x10 grid are dedicated to receiving the stems and the strokes of this font whereas the other half is always white, making millimetre rythm quite unique, totally settled, like a bar code. This grid based design, reminding a pixel grid, makes Millimetre works quite well on screen too.

Millimetre is a libre and open-source font currently still in developpment. Contribute.
