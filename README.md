# Millimetre

Millimetre is a serie of fonts constructed on a grid based on the metric system. It follows the decimal logic of this system. In this spirit, when you typeset Millimetre, you don’t use the archaic unit of the point but the millimetre, centimetre, decimeter or the meter itself for the really big sizes.

Each em is vertically and horizontally divided in 10 units. Printed at a 1 cm size, the strokes of the regular will be 1 mm thick. Both white spaces and black stems fit on this grid. Half of the lines and columns of this 10x10 grid are receive the stems and the strokes of this font whereas the other half is always white, making millimetre rythm quite unique, totally settled, like a bar code. This grid based design, aligned to a pixel grid, makes Millimetre works quite well on screen too.

From a stylistic point of view, Millimetre is a geometric, constructed sans serif, with quite wide proportions even is the with of several glyphs could contradict this statement. With its rectangular look and closed terminals, Millimetre reminds 60’s sans such as Eurostile. Far from runing away from this graphic universe, Millimetre embraces the retro-futuristic, architectural, technological and science-fictionnal connotations that comes with it.

If the regular never leaves the grid, the other weights are more sensible whereas keeping a really close rythm. Millimetre Bold weight is twice the one of the regular and the light one is half the one of the regular.

This type family comes with a wide range of technic and geometric ornaments allowing to create patterns exactly dialoguing with the text. These ornaments are inspired by the early age of the computer era and by the technical graphs used in the printing business.

Millimetre is a libre and open-source font currently still in developpment. Contribute.
